# Starjacking and Typosquatting: A Developer's Nightmare 🕵️‍♂️

Two concerning practices, Starjacking and Typosquatting, have emerged in recent years, putting unsuspecting developers at risk. Let's dive into what these threats are and how to protect your codebase.

---

## What is Starjacking?

Starjacking is a devious tactic in which malicious actors link a package hosted on a package manager (like npm, PyPI, or RubyGems) to a different, unrelated package's repository on GitHub. This repository often seems legitimate, misleading developers into thinking they are using a trustworthy package. In reality, they are loading a potentially compromised package, risking security vulnerabilities and breaches.

## How Typosquatting Plays a Role

To maximize their reach and deception, attackers combine Starjacking with Typosquatting. Typosquatting involves creating package names that are similar to popular, legitimate ones but contain subtle typos or misspellings. Unsuspecting developers who make a typo when installing packages may end up unintentionally installing a malicious package.

## Protecting Your Projects 🛡️

1. **Verify Package Sources:** Always double-check the source of the packages you intend to use. Review the package's repository on GitHub or the package manager's official website to ensure they match.

2. **Use Package Lockfiles:** Lockfiles like `package-lock.json` and `requirements.txt` help ensure that the exact versions of dependencies are installed, reducing the risk of malicious substitutions.

3. **Audit Your Dependencies:** Regularly run security audits using tools like `npm audit` or `snyk` to identify vulnerabilities in your dependencies and update them accordingly.

## Protecting Your Projects (contd.)

4. **Beware of Typos:** Be vigilant when typing package names. One misplaced letter can lead to a malicious package being installed.

5. **Community Vigilance:** Report suspicious packages or repositories to the package manager's maintainers or relevant authorities. Stay informed about security alerts and updates.

6. **Check Package Popularity:** Packages with a large user base and active development are generally more trustworthy. Favor well-maintained packages with a strong community.
